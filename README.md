## 1
Apply the binary search algorithm to the bday problem. In order to have a sorted list use the method ```sort_bday``` that will return a sorted birthday property 

## 2

Using one of the algorithms you have written, copy it and adjust it to the birthday problem so that it sorts the list of tuple according to month and day sorting.

Hint: you should end up with the same list as the product of running ```sort_bday```
